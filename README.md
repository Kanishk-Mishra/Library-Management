# Library Management System

## Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a software application designed to simplify library operations by keeping track of books, book issues, and user details. Traditionally, library records were maintained in physical registers, making data loss a significant risk. This system ensures secure and efficient record-keeping while allowing future enhancements like book recommendations through machine learning.

## Scope of Work
This system provides an easy-to-use interface for managing library records. In future iterations, machine learning models can be integrated to recommend books based on a user's borrowing history. Additionally, the system ensures data security with a backup feature.

## Features
The Library Management System includes the following core functionalities:

- **Add Books** – Insert new books into the database.
- **Remove Books** – Delete outdated or damaged books.
- **Issue Books** – Assign books to users and track due dates.
- **User Management** – Store details of individuals who borrow books.

## Technology Stack
- **Python (Flask)** – For backend development and server-side logic.
- **SQLite/MySQL** – For database management and record-keeping.
- **Jinja2** – For rendering dynamic web pages.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For the user interface.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kanishk-Mishra/Library-Management.git

## Future Enhancements
- **Machine Learning-Based Book Recommendations** – Suggest books based on user preferences.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering** – Enable users to find books quickly.
- **Role-Based Access & Control** – Add admin and user roles for better access control.

## Conclusion
The **Library Management System** is a scalable and efficient solution for managing library records. With planned future updates, it aims to enhance the library experience by providing personalized recommendations and ensuring data security.
